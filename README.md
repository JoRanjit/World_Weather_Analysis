# World_Weather_Analysis

## This project will help a customer plan their vacation trip based on their temparature preferences

### The project has 3 parts:
  1. Retrieve Weather Data
  2. Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
  3. Create a Travel Itinerary Map


#### Part 1 -Retrieve Weather Data
  * In this module, we created a database in csv with a sample of 700+ cities around the world. 
  * This database could be used by the customer to pull their preferred location

#### Part 2 - Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
  * In this module, we asked for customer's prferred temperature range
  * The range is between 70&deg;F and 85&deg;F
  * With this range we developed a travel destimation heat map that customer could use to plan his trip.
  * This heat map has the following information added as pop-ups:
      -- Hotel name 
      -- City
      -- Country
      -- Current weather description with the maximum temperature
